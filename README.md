# World-Dev-Indicators

The Jupyter notebook in this repository extracts life expectancy and other data from an sqlite database of World Development Indicators provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/worldbank/world-development-indicators). Then, machine learning in scikit-learn using lasso regression is applied to examine which predictors best explain differences in life expectancy between countries.
